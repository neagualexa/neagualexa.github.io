## üîß Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Setup using instructions from [https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neagualexa/neagualexa.github.io.git
   cd neagualexa.github.io
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

#### Deploy the React App

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command runs the `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts defined in `package.json`:
- **predeploy**: Builds a distributable version of the React app in the `build` folder
- **deploy**: Pushes the build contents to the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository

You can specify a custom commit message:
```bash
npm run deploy -- -m "Deploy React app to GitHub Pages"
```

#### Configure GitHub Pages (One-time setup)

1. **Navigate to GitHub repository settings**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on the "Settings" tab
   - In the sidebar, under "Code and automation", click on "Pages"

2. **Configure Build and deployment settings**:
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `gh-pages`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
   - Click "Save"

#### Store Source Code on GitHub

After deployment, commit and push your source code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure React app for deployment to GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

**Repository Structure**:
- `main` branch: Contains the React app source code
- `gh-pages` branch: Contains the built/distributable version
