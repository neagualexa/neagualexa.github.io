We used a 360-degree camera mounted on a legged manipulator (Boston Dynamics SPOT) to enable the interactive exploration of a remote human-populated environment. We hypothesised that the 360-degree VR user interface will increase immersion and trust by enabling interactivity and adaptability to different remote scenarios in contrast to traditional 2D interfaces.",
